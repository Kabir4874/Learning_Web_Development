          Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the
          creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the
          kernel for a number of operating systems. He also created the version
          control system Git. Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in
          Helsinki, Finland. He studied computer science at the University of
          Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in
          1991. Since then, the Linux kernel has become one of the most widely
          used kernels in the world, powering everything from smartphones to
          supercomputers.

        <strong>Linux</strong> is an open-source operating system like other
        operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, iOS, Google
        android, etc. An operating system is a software that enables the
        communication between computer hardware and software. It conveys input
        to get processed by the processor and brings output to the hardware to
        display it. This is the basic function of an operating system. Although
        it performs many other important tasks, let's not talk about that.
